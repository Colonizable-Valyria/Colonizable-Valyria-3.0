EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.4;I embrace the Old God’s Gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.4;Best not to dwell upon dreams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.5;Hunting bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.10;There is virtue in restraint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.11;Queen Danaerys Stormborn felt that slavery was a cruel injustice to be stamped out wherever possible. You bear her blood, will you follow her example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.11;It is not my problem to solve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.14;Not for nothing is the Stark sigil a direwolf: you have long had vivid dreams of being some great beast of the forest stalking its prey at the head of a mighty pack, now to your amazement a direwolf has emerged from the woods.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.16;My ancestor Robb Stark was a skilled tactician who whilst little more than a child smashed the armies of the West and the Iron Throne, securing the independence of the North and the Trident. Lately I have been reading more and more of his exploits and am becoming intrigued by his pursuit of strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.16;Strategy is fascinating maybe I should study it more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.16;Interesting as this is, I have more pressing matters to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.17;Not for nothing is the castle of the Boltons called the Dreadfort – many of my ancestors have been known for their cruel and inventive methods of torturing others: it is said that skinning their foes was just the start for men like King Robar Redarm. Should I seek to follow their example, or should I chart my own course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.17;Others deserve to know pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.17;I am not my ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.18;The Starks are known as an honourable and just lot – it is said the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. As men like Cregan Stark showed justice is not always the same thing as leniency and it is a hard path to walk. Should I follow my Stark Blood or are these views antiquated and pointless?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.18;Justice has its merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.18;The need for flexibility outweighs the need for justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.19;The old blood of the First Men or even the giants themselves must surely flow very strongly in your veins!

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.20;The old blood of the First Men must surely flow very strongly in your veins!

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.21;Bravery is recklessness, I am not my ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.22;Family, Duty, Honour – these are the words of House Tully. As a bearer of the Tully bloodline many will expect you to live by these values too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.22;These are words to live by.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.22;What a load of nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.822;Your ancestors valued the bonds that made the family whole, understanding strength came from kindred. Will you be inspired by their example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.822;Family first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.822;I never much cared for my kin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.23;A number of your ancestors acquired reputations for piety, conviction, and religious belief. Should you follow in their example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.26;Aerys was a madman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.27;Morgon Banefort, the last Banefort King, cursed his Lannister enemies before they put him to death. Soon after the lions of Casterly Rock broke free slaying three of Loreon Lannister’s sons.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.29;You bear the blood of the Karstarks, who have held lands just south of the Wall since Karlon Stark put down a rebel lord. The constant threat of wildling raids and the precariousness of life that far north meant that the Karstarks had to become tough and fierce, with a lifestyle that predisposed them to being strong enough to deal with everything life threw at them, as a result you have obtained a strong and robust physique that is now clear to see for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.29;I have become rather strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Regardless there is a clear truth in the rumours that my[From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] takes after bears in the way that [From.GetSheHe] behaves. Today a great bear has emerged from the woods and [From.GetFirstName] has claimed the beast as their companion. It follows them everywhere and obeys every command it is given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.59;Though you were not born showing the strength of the First Men, you have always been rather robust, and over the years your natural athleticism has strengthened you to the point where you have become rather brawny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.59;I have become rather strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.60;Since the accident crippled me I have been having such vivid and disturbing dreams. In the last one a Three-Eyed Crow told me that I would never walk again, but that I would learn to fly. I do not know what to make of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.60;What do these dreams mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.61;Last night I had a dream where I was wearing the skin of a cat, wandering the halls and looking for mice, when I happened accross some shadowy figures speaking in hushed tones. They were oblivious to my presence and I was able to creep close enough to hear their conversation, and I was able to hear some most concerning plans that they were plotting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.61;Their plot is revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.62;Last night I had a dream where I was wearing the skin of a bat, flying through the courtyard in the dead of night, when I happened accross some shadowy figures speaking in hushed tones.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.64;Last night I had a green dream where I was seeing through the eyes of trees and hearing on the ears of the wind when I saw shadow figures speaking in hushed tones.

EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.64;Their plot is revealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.70;My ancestor King Daeron the Young Dragon was a skilled tactician who whilst little more than a child smashed the armies of the Martells, conquering Dorne, a feat not even Aegon the Conqueror could achieve. Lately I have been reading more and more of his exploits and am becoming intrigued by his pursuit of strategy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.70;Strategy is fascinating maybe I should study it more…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.70;Interesting as this is, I have more pressing matters to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.71;My Bloodline has long been associated with faith, piety, and devotion to the Gods. Perhaps I should emphasise my dedication and take a vow of celibacy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.71;I shall ignore the appetites of the flesh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.71;Maybe that's going a little too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.72;King Baelor was a model of piety and faith, perhaps I should follow in his footsteps and live my life in the fullness of faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.72;Piety is the mark of the righteous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.72;Baelor was blessed, but his mind was addled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.73;King Baelor was a model of piety and faith and claimed that the Seven spoke to him, and gave him commands. Could these voices... could they truly be the Seven? Do they speak through me too?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.73;Behold I am also blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.73;No, I do not hear the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.74;Long has it said that those with the Farwynd blood are blessed by the Drowned God, with a connection to the beasts of the sea: I have long had vivid dreams of swimming in the cold deep ocean, now a sea lion has come ashore.

EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.77;Personal combat is in my blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.77;Dueling bores me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.78;What a load of rubbish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.79;When I was growing up my nurse would often tell me that those who bore the Westford blood bore the blood of First Men, sometimes able to wear the skins of beasts, I always thought them childish tales, but today I encountered a large wild dog as I was out riding, it eyes seeming to peer into my very soul. Strangely docile it seems to be seeking me out and followed me all the way back to the stables, almost as if it recognises me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.880;What am I doing???;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.900;You have been feeling increasingly on edge of late, hearing others whisper about you in corners, plotting against you, threatening you and all you hold dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.900;Well everyone IS out to get me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.81;I dreamt I was flying, that a crow came to me and opened my third eye, that I looked deep into the heart of winter, that I saw through the eyes of weirwoods, seeing the past present and future, seeing the very truth that lies beneath the world. When I awoke I knew I was chosen by the Old Gods, that I am a greenseer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.82;I have been having vivid dreams of late, dreams of the leaf and stone, dreams of what is past and what may yet be to come. Could these dreams have meaning? Could these dreams be messages from the Old Gods themselves?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.83;In my dreams I had a vision of an ancient being, seated on a throne of weirwood, they told me they are a greenseer and here to teach me the secrets of the Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.83;I will learn from them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.83;I will not trouble myself with this knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.84;After many vivid dreams, pushing my mind into those of beasts and trees, and consuming paste made from weirwood seed, I have at last mastered the knowledge of a true greenseer and my master has passed on their mantle to me. Now, if they wish, they may die in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.86;I have taught the new greenseer many secrets of the truth that lies beneath the world and the ways of the Old Gods, now I have nothing left to teach and they are a fully fledged greenseer.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.8601;I had taught my student much, however it seems that the Old Gods needed them more than I, and they have died, becoming one with the weirwoods. I must wait for a new student to emerge before I can finally accept my own death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.87;The Greenseer who taught me the ways of the Old Gods has decided to become one with the trees, leaving his body and weirwood throne behind, I now must take up his mantle and guide the Children of the Forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.90;The men of House Manderly have long been known to be rather big boned. Over recent weeks you have noticed that you have perhaps been a bit too eager at the feast hall and it is now starting to show...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.90;No I must resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.91;The men of House Manderly have long been known to be rather big boned.

EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.91;I have become rather strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.92;Those whose blood you bear have achieved many great and mighty deeds, carving their names into history through their achievments. Of late you find yourself reflecting on these grand deeds and your pride in them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.92;I have become rather proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.92;I should stay humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.93;The men of House Slynt have long been known to be rather plain-faced. Over recent weeks you have noticed that your face is seeming sullen and out of proportion. Perhaps your Slynt blood is starting to show...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.98;During my training and meditation with the Elder in the forest glade I felt my mind begin to forge a strong new connection with a new animal. In time I came to realise I had acquired a new skin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.98;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.99;I have come to realise that the Gods I once followed were false idols, and that true power rests with the Old Gods of the First Men and Children of the Forest. The Gods of tree and stone, of stream and wind. From this day forward I will worship only them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.4502;You conduct the rite, drawing upon all your arcane knowledge, and then you wait, praying to see some sign of life. After three days of waiting you begin to give up all hope, when suddenly, as you inspect the tree you see a bright red spot high above you. As you climb up to it you see that it is a small, blood red leaf bud. The weirwood lives once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.4502;Praise the Old Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.4503;You conduct the rite, drawing upon all your arcane knowledge, and then you wait, praying to see some sign of life. After several days of waiting you give up all hope, and accept that despite your best efforts, the weirwood remains dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.4503;I was a fool to even try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.460;I bear the blood of Garth Greenhand, a mighty king of the First Men who wore a crown of vines and flowers and made the land bloom. On the summit of the hill that would become Highgarden he planted a mighty oak that became the Oakenseat, the living throne of the Gardener Kings. But the Dornish destroyed it long ago, in the reign King Garth X, leaving nothing but ash and withered roots. Yet I have gained an understanding of the mysteries of the world, might be able to coax the dead wood back to life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.460;It will take much knowledge, but I must try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.460;I will leave the tree as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.461;Restoring the mighty Oakenseat is beyond my current learning, I must both gain a greater understanding of plants and the magics of Garth Greenhand than I currently possess. I must seek out other famous trees and places where knowledge can be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.461;I will seek out this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.461;I will also take up an interest in gardening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.462;Whilst in Raventree Hall I was able to visit the dead weirwood that gives the castle its name. The Brackens poisoned it long ago, leaving it dead and leafless, but there are runes carved on the stones around it and I felt a whisper of power within them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.462;Perhaps I should make a copy of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.463;Whilst in Raventree Hall I was able to visit the dead weirwood that gives the castle its name. The Brackens poisoned it long ago, leaving it dead and leafless, but by careful stewardship it has been regrown, much as I hope to do with the Oakenseat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.463;There is much to learn here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.464;It is rare that the Green Men of the Isle of Faces allow an outsider to visit their island. Yet, perhaps because they knew my purpose, they allowed me to row across the Gods' Eye. They did not speak a word to me, but they allowed me to see the trees of the Island, each carved with a weeping face…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.464;The eyes stared back, there is an intelligence to these trees…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.465;The men of the Night's Watch use a grove of nine weirwoods in the haunted forest half a league from Castle Black for their devotions. On my visit the Lord Commander was good enough to take me there and I was able to see the great trees for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.465;There is a power to these trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.466;The lands of Ironrath abound with Ironwoods and those that tend and harvest them know much of tree-lore, whilst there I was able to learn how they managed and cared for the great trees of the Wolfswood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.466;They are not oaks but there is much to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.467;It is said that Rowan Goldtree was so bereft when her lover left her for a rich rival that she wrapped an apple in her golden hair and planted it upon a hill. From the apple grew a tree whose bark, leaves and fruit were yellow gold. As I passed through Goldengrove I was able to walk among the yellow trees of Goldengrove supposedly descended from that magical tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.467;They are not oaks but there is much to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.468;High Heart was once home to a ring of mighty weirwoods at the crest of the Hill. The pious Andal King Erreg cut them all down, leaving thirty-one white stumps, but as I visited the hill, I felt their power still lingering whilst Erreg is long gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.468;They are not oaks but there is much to learn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.469;During your stay in the Citadel, you are able to talk to apprentices studying herblore and listen to a few lectures on the subject. The Maesters were impressed by your learning and before you leave they give you a half dozen or so treatises on the subject, including one on the legends of Garth Greenhand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.469;This will be most useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.46001;You assemble all your notes, prepare your poultices and runes and say a quick prayer to the Gods to bless your endeavour. The time has come to try and coax the Oakenseat back to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmore_bloodlines.46001;Let the rite begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmore_bloodlines.46001;Best to wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.46002;You conduct the rite, drawing upon all your arcane knowledge, and then you wait, praying to see some sign of life. After three days of waiting you begin to give up all hope, when suddenly, as you inspect the withered roots you see a bright green speck of new growth sprouting from them.

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.46003;You conduct the rite, drawing upon all your arcane knowledge, and then you wait, praying to see some sign of life. After several days of waiting you give up all hope, and accept that despite your best efforts, the Oakenseat remains dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmore_bloodlines.806;With Cersei revealed as an incestuous adultress I really should consider who shall carry on my line. I have fathered many bastards over the years.

EVTtitlembs_valyrian_quest.2;The Basilisk of Gogossos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.2;The Isle of Tears was once the site of a great city founded by the Ghiscari and captured by the Valyrian Freehold during the Third Ghiscari War who renamed it Gogossos. The dragonlords used it as a penal colony for the worst criminals. New methods of torture were used and blood magic is said to have been practiced on the Isle. Gogossos grew powerful through slavery and sorcery during the Century of Blood, with some calling it the "Tenth Free City", until the Red Death brought ruin to the Basilisk Islands.\nNow only ruins remain as you begin your reconstruction. Beneath an ancient temple to the Valyrian Gods your builders have found a strange room carved in Valyrian glyphs and with a life sized stone basilisk with a gaping open mouth in the centre. One who speaks Old High Valyrian tells you they speak of a sacrificial ritual and a great reward for those who will grant the basilisk the blood it craves...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_valyrian_quest.2;I will do what I must, have one of the [Root.GetPeasantNamePlural] bound and brought here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.3;The prisoner is place with their head in the mouth of the stone basilisk as the glyphs instruct, suddenly the jaws slam shut, removing the man's head in a single stroke. As his blood drains from his body a section of wall lifts up revealing a secret room full of treasures, and, greatest of all a Valyrian Steel blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.4;You puzzle over the glyphs, it seems this was a sacrificial chamber used by the Gogossans to conduct their cruel flesh-changing rituals. After several hours you feel ready to circumvent the spells and with great exertion you bind the powers of this place to yourself. As you do a section of wall lifts up revealing a secret room full of treasures, and, greatest of all a Valyrian Steel blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitlembs_valyrian_quest.5;The Chimera of Valyria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.5;The City of Monsters Mantarys at the northern tip of the Sea of Sighs was one of the many cities founded by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and its deformed inhabitants remember more of Valyria than most.\nNow that you have reunited the Lands of Valyria once more a group of twisted Mantyran priests come to you, acclaiming you as true heir to the Freehold. They bring you an ancient Valyrian Steel greatsword that they have held as a sacred relic since before the Doom and offer to teach you the secrets of their order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_valyrian_quest.5;I am the true heir of Valyria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.6;The Dothraki call the forests south of the Shivering Sea the Kingdom of the Ifequevron, telling legends of diminuitive woods walkers, a small, shy and gentle folk. Now that the forests are being settled once more a strange group of these Ifquevron have come to your court asking for an audience with you. The creatures speak your tongue with a strange, alien accent and offer you a bargain, if you will pledge them gifts of leaf, stone, and water, and make your subjects honour the forests and sacred trees signing a pact for yourself and your successors, they will teach you ancient secrets and give you mighty gifts they obtained from ancient men who "rode upon the very sky itself".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTtitlembs_valyrian_quest.7;The Crown and the Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_valyrian_quest.7;[From.GetName] was once the site of a great castle, overlooking the Narrow Sea. In Kin of the Stag Maester Hubert claims that it was built by Andals and was the seat of petty kings who were eventually brought to heal by the Storm Kings. Almost all of the castle was in ruins when you started the rebuilding, piles of fallen stone everywhere and overgrown with ivy. One day whilst clearing some rubble your builders found a passageway leading below ground to a set of catacombs with grand tombs and carved sephulchres of the ancient kings, and within them many chests filled with ancient gold and coins! They have even found what must be the Royal crown, and, lying on a the tomb engraved with the image of a mighty knight, a strange sword with a pale blade, amazingly sharp, unblemished by the centuries. The workers whisper that it is Just Maid, the blade of Ser Galladon of Morne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTtitlembs_theon_notification.1;Theon Turncloak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_theon_notification.1;News from [From.Capital.GetName] [Root.GetTitledFirstName], it seems that after being forced to choose between his true family and his foster family Prince Theon Greyjoy of the Iron Isles has chosen to betray his House. It seems that after being ordered by his father, Iron King Balon Greyjoy, to harry the Stony Shore Theon decided to defect. Feigning loyalty to his father he sailed his longship North, before deliberately leading his own men into a Northman ambush. Some of his crew, including his squire Wex Pyke, chose to defect to King Robb Stark, the rest were executed. Now Prince Theon has once again pledged his sword and ship to the Starks and has declared his father Balon a fool and a madman for seeking war with Winterfell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_theon_notification.1;What an interesting development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitlembs_theon_notification.2;Theon Turncloak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_theon_notification.2;It seems that it is as I feared. The green lands have made my son soft, and the Starks have made him theirs. After pledging me his loyalty and taking his longship North with the Damphair and the Cleftjaw to harry the Stony Shore, Theon separated from the main force, taking the crews of two longships further inland, only to purposefully lead them into a Northman ambush. Announcing that his loyalties lay with that pup Robb Stark, Theon bade his crew follow him in turning their cloaks which some shamefully did including his squire Wex Pyke, the rest were executed by the Northmen. Now Theon calls me a fool and a madman, and has offered the Starks his sword and his ship in service!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_theon_notification.2;He will pay for this betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitlembs_theon_notification.3;A True Friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_theon_notification.3;Some welcome news at last it seems. After Balon Greyjoy spurned my offer of an alliance I feared I would one day have to face Theon on the battlefield. Thankfully, he chose friendship and honour over his deceitful kin. Pretending to agree to his father's orders he sailed his longship the 'Sea Bitch' north to the Stony Shore. Once there he separated from the main force, and led the crews of two longships further inland, before departing alone to scout ahead, whereupon he contacted Northern scouts and arranged an ambush. Suspecting nothing the Ironborn raiders were captured to a man. Some, including Theon's squire, agreed to pledge their loyalty to Winterfell, the rest were executed. Now Theon fights by my side once more, having proven his loyalty beyond question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_theon_notification.3;I will not forget this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x



EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.1;The North has marched to war, ready to avenge the execution of Lord Eddard by the vile Lannisters. Though I have eaten a few too many eels to ride to war once more, the men of White Harbour honour the oaths made a thousand years ago to the Lords of Winterfell, led by my brave sons. Now ravens bring word that there is to be a Harvest Feast at Winterfell, with [Root.Liege.Heir.GetTitledFirstName] serving as the Stark in Winterfell. Perhaps I should attend the feast myself to remind House Stark that none are more faithful that none are so faithful as House Manderly, and perhaps make a few suggestions of my own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_manderly_fleet.1;To Winterfell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmbs_manderly_fleet.1;A man does not cross a hundred leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.2;The journey from White Harbour to Winterfell was pleasant enough and I now await [Root.Liege.Heir.GetTitledFirstName] in [Root.Liege.Heir.GetHerHis] [Root.Liege.Heir.GetSisterBrother]'s solar. I must decide what I wish to say - should I merely exchange pleasantries and assure him of House Manderly's continued devotion, or should I make proposals of my own - perhaps I should remind [Root.Liege.Heir.GetTitledFirstName] that the North has had no strength at sea for hundreds of years, since Brandon the Burner put the torch to his father's ships - where better to build a new fleet than White Harbour?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_manderly_fleet.2;[Root.Liege.Heir.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] are both sure to approve of such a suggestion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.3;A letter has come from the Maester detailing the recent harvest feast at Winterfell.

[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] reminded [Root.Heir.GetTitledFirstName] that we have had no strength at sea for hundreds of years, since Brandon the Burner put the torch to his father's ships. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] said that I have but to give him the gold and within the year [From.GetSheHe] will float me sufficient galleys to take Dragonstone and King's Landing both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.301;You receive a raven from [From.GetTitledFirstNameWithDynasty], he received your recent proposal of a new warfleet from [From.Heir.GetHerHis] Maester and thanks you for the suggestion, but he laments that there is precious little coin to spare for such a project.

EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.4;As you draft your reply to [d_whiteharbor.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] a thought strikes you: [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameWithDynasty] says that his lands are facing more frequent raids from Wildlings - they cross the Bay of Seals in little boats and wash up on [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetHerHis] shores, [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says if if he had but some longships he would be able to keep [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetHerHis] people safe. Meanwhile [d_whiteharbor.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] needs large quantities of timber to build [d_whiteharbor.Holder.GetHerHis] ships. Perhaps there is a way to solve both issues at once: [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has forests of tall pine and old oak, [d_whiteharbor.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has shipwrights and sailors in plenty, together they ought to be able to float enough longships to guard both their coasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.5;[From.GetTitledFirstNameWithDynasty] has received my proposal to build a warfleet at White Harbour, [From.GetHerHisCap] Grace approves of it heartily and sends the gold for us to begin. [From.GetHerHisCap] Grace also writes that [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameWithDynasty] of Last Hearth is facing increased raids from Wildlings sailing across the Bay of Seals. [From.GetTitledFirstName] writes that if I coordinate with [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] he can provide the timber I need to build the fleet. Doing so would certainly please both [From.GetHerHisCap] Grace and [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], provide a cheap source of good timber but I would have to give one ship in every four over to the Umbers, perhaps I should source the timber myself to retain control of the entire fleet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmbs_manderly_fleet.5;I shall write to [d_lasthearth.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and negotiate the timber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmbs_manderly_fleet.5;Best to look elsewhere for timber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmbs_manderly_fleet.501;You receive a raven from [From.Capital.GetName], it seems [From.GetTitledFirstNameWithDynasty] has received funds from [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameWithDynasty] to build a new fleet for the North. Such an undertaking will surely be of great use in the current war and any future conflicts, but will require a great amount of timber, so [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstNameWithNick] proposes that [Root.Capital.GetName] and [From.Capital.GetName] work together.

Now you have Sansa securely in the Vale, safe from those who would do her harm. You have dyed her hair and now pretend she is your bastard daughter 'Alayne.'

The only clue seems to be that Ser Dontos Hollard, the drunken fool of a knight, was found dead, floating in the Harbour with three crossbow bolts in his chest. Was he her accomplice or her victim?

EVTOPTAvulture_king.1;Who is this so called "King"?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mbs_vultureking.3;The outlaw known as "Vulture King" is now a threat too great to ignore. He has gathered thousands of men and your vassals are unable to face him to put and end to his twisted reign. Now, in his madness, the Vulture King of the Red Mountains has declared war to all of Dorne enemies. Should he be allowed to act with impunity for much longer, he will cause chaos along the border.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAvulture_king.3;This Vulture is no "King", but an outlaw and a traitor ready to be hunted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_mbs_vultureking.4;You have heard the news of someone called "Vulture King" in the red mountains.

EVTDESC_mbs_vultureking.5;You are exploring near the red mountains when someone claims to have found something interesting. As you approach, you realize many soldiers lived in this place once, as many old weapons and even corpses lie forgotten near the entrance of a dark cave. As you bravely go through the place, you found more and more evidences of the military importance this place had for someone in the past. Finally, in what appears to be the final "room" of this place, you found more weapons, old clothes, and what matters the most, gold. Someone should have hidden it inside this cave many years ago, and everyone who knew of his existance must be dead, or they would have returned already to reclaim this wealth. Now they belong to you, but you cant help but wonder: who owned this hidden lair, and what happened to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ca_castamere_ruins_desc;During the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion the Reynes retreated to Castamere, where Ser Tywin Lannister, ignoring Reynard Reyne offer for peace, had his miners bury Castamere's entrances, then he dammed the pool's stream and diverted it into a mine entrance, flooding the underground chambers of Castamere and drowning those trapped inside. Tywin also had the surface buildings put to the torch. Since that moment, Castamere has been a ruin, nothing more than a mine from which House Lannister gain wealth, while the Reynes remain trapped inside the flooded chambers of the once mighty castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The latest being a blocked room where your men found a bunch of finery laid out, they belive it to be for some kind of banquet House Reyne wanted to celebrate. Fortunately there are no corpses in the room, but they have found some gold coins, probably abandoned in a rush once they knew they needed to escape the castle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
